Increasing the perceived value of your SaaS in the eyes of investors is something you want to do as a founder. 

You need funds to build your business, but the SaaS model doesn't allow you to be self-funded. But, what do I mean by perceived value?  And how to increase it? This is what we will talk about in this article. 

                

## The truth about SaaS startup valuation

The value of your SaaS isn't the idea, but the tech it uses. It's not about the vision, the branding, or its cash flow. 

No, the value in the eyes of investors is a function of risk. I mean by that, that your valuation will depend on the risk inside the company. The more risk, the less value. And the less value, the more share % investors will get when they accept to fund your company. 

You obviously want to raise the value of your company as much as possible, but this is not an article about fundraising and pre-money/post-money valuation. 

## The inverstor's checklist

                

Let's talk about the risks I mentioned earlier. What are they?

In his mind, the investor asks these kinds of questions: 
1. What market do you serve? Is it growing? 
2. Does your solution deliver the promised benefits?
3. Are people willing to pay for this? 
4. Will many pay for this? 
5. Do you have a repeatable way to acquire customers?
6. Is your process scalable? 
7. Can you grow without encountering an excessive churn rate?
8. Are you profitable? Are you making money doing this? 
9. If we give you the resources needed to really hit the gas, will your organization be able to scale? 

In short, these are the kinds of questions they will ask and it's your job to give them an answer. In fact, your valuation grows as you solve each of these challenges. The more you solve, the less risky it is to fund your company so the bigger your valuation. It looks like this : 

                <Image src={valuation} alt="Graph representing how valuation of a SaaS startup increase, and it's not overtime but as you solve critical challenges and reduce risk in the eyes of investors." />

If you are able to answer all of these questions, you have proven that your firm isn't just a simple SaaS but a cash-generating monster. 


## How to increase your valuation

The first step to increasing your valuation is to know where you are on the ladder :  

The product market/fit phase is represented by the initial questions. The scaling phase is represented by the last question. The questions in between represent what David Skok calls the RSP Phase.

He explains that something is missing in the "Lean Startup" book. The transition between the lean startup of the product/market fit and the scaling phase. This "hidden" phase is the cause of SaaS startup failures. They failed to solve really important challenges and tried to scale

According to him, the solution is to build a Repeatable, Scalable, and Profitable Growth Machine. If you want to know more about this, I wrote a practical guide on How to build such a machine. You can download it by clicking to the link below.

Now you know where you are and what's inside the minds of investors, you just need to solve each of these challenges one at a time, in that order, as fast as possible (easy right?)

Just like I wrote in this a previous article, this is a race against time and you have limited resources. 

Where are you on the investor's mind ladder right now? Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and share your thoughts.
