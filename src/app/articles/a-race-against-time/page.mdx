Running out of cash—a perpetual concern for SaaS startup founders. Have you ever asked yourself this vital question lately? Are you on track to hit those all-important milestones for a successful fundraise?

These questions keep your head focused on your goals and remind you that this is a race against time. Missing the milestones and running dry means Game Over. This is the harsh truth of the startup game.

                

## The Startup Game

To win this game, you must understand the rules and your role in it. It's the founder's duty to ensure the firm progresses at the right speed and in the right direction. Aligning the entire company towards a unique, focused goal.
Beating the clock requires extreme focus and discipline. Yet, to achieve this, you must navigate inside a storm. A storm of unlimited options with limited visibility and resources.

You don't have the luxury to take your time. There are just so many things to do, and you can't get away with vague business goals like "getting more clients."

No, what you need to do is this. Tracing a clear path to follow, with objectives along the road. Here are the steps I use for that.

## Step 1: Draw the Cashout Graph

                <Image src={cashoutgraph} alt="Graph representing the decrease of cash available over time." />

A lot of things can happen that could impact the accuracy of cash flow projection. Market changes, delayed revenue, unexpected expenses, or churn, to name a few. Always keep an eye on this. You want to know when you'll run out of cash and when to start fundraising.

## Step 2: Define a Timescale to Accomplish What You Must Accomplish

You want to aim to finish three months before point zero. It should give you the time to find investors before the end of the race.

## Step 3: Define a Destination

You want to define it now and not before step 2. The reason behind this is that the more time you have, the more you can achieve. The more you achieve, the better your fundraise.
Align your destination with the investor's mind ladder. For example, this could be something like "Making our sales motion a repeatable process." You can go read an article about this here.

## Step 4: Destructure the Destination into Small Objectives

Here is the planning phase. We want to list out everything we need that is required to achieve this goal. Using our previous destination, it could be something like:
* Create a sales process that matches the avatar's buying process.
* Create our customer avatar.
* Define one target and one use case.
* [ ... ] 

Those are must-haves and not nice to have. In other words, we want to find the minimum steps required for this unique destination. You'll improve everything later. It doesn't have to be perfect right at the start. The more time we spend here, the simpler the race.
One word, though, this is a balance between strategy and urgency. Don't fall under the strategy trap and fail to execute your plan. It's not uncommon that we are highly motivated to challenge the status quo, in business and our life, just to find out that in the end, we did nothing. The status quo won this war.

## Step 5: Prioritize Sub-goals

Here we do one thing at a time, and we put all of our effort into it. You need to decide what to do first. No distraction! The previous list becomes:
1. Define one target and one use case.
2. Create our customer avatar.
3. Create a sales process that matches the avatar's buying process.
4. [ ... ]

## Step 6: Ready... Start

Now stop thinking, start doing. A good plan is good, but executing it makes it perfect (or not... if it's a bad plan with poor execution skills).
At this moment, you may ask yourself this question: "Will we have enough time for this?" The answer is "it depends" and it's the topic of this article here.
