The number one enemy of a startup is the time tiking. Cash is burning, it's your fuel, and your goal is to arrive at the next station. The problem is the rails are incomplete and to attain your destination you'll have to build from scratch the railway.

## No matter what, cash will still be burning

While you are busy with this, you cannot turn off the engine. The cash will constantly burn no matter what you do, you can't control this.

What you can control, however, is the speed at which your engine consumes the cash, and wins enough time to build the railway and arrive at the station. You decide to reduce the combustion as much as possible. 

But, after some calculation, you realize that your team isn't as good as you want and they aren't fast enough at building rails. Maybe they just don't know how to do this, they are not experts. 
                

## The expert comes

To win time and achieve your goal, you hire a railway constructor expert. That was a good decision. Thanks to the expert's training and guidance, you are on time now. The clock will be beaten!

Reducing the cash consumption, and reallocating where it has the highest impact is a good strategy. You keep that in mind for now, this will be useful for future journeys. 

All you have to do now is to arrive at the station and... do it again! But now, you know how to do this. 


## End of the story - The Cash Burning Posture

Through this analogy, I wanted to illustrate the importance of multiple things.

The first is the adoption of a cash-burning conservatism. After a fundraise, it can be tempting to spend a lot of what you think is important. 
New team, new tech, new office...

Sure they aren't bad investments but it's not necessarily the right time for this. The order of doing matters a lot. The thing is that you have a lot of distance to travel and you don't know how long it will take. What you know however is when you'll run out of cash and who would fund a company that did nothing significant with the cash they were given? 

No, you want to adopt this posture, win time, and think about how to get the most impact with the minimum resources. 

## Experts create value and impact

Here comes the expert. They may seem costly at first but what they can bring to the table is often worth it. 

* Perspective 
* Knowledge 
* Skill and Expertise 

Being an outsider allows the expert to see things, invisible to the people inside. They are not biased, nor submit to hierarchical relationships. 

The experts know what to do, and when to do it. With its guidance, you'll not wander blindly, and you'll not get lost. And that alone is saving a lot of time, cash, and a lot less frustration. 

Finally, the expert hones his craft. He's constantly at the edge of his field. Imagine now that he transfers his knowledge to your company and infuses your team with better capabilities. 

## Grow your business 

Knowledge transfer is a sure way to not only grow your firm but also your people. Use the knowledge you just gained so you can grow your business in a minimum amount of time and with the minimum amount of resources. May you arrive to the next station. 

At this moment, you may wonder if an expert can you with that matter. Feel free to book a call with me to see if I can help you.
